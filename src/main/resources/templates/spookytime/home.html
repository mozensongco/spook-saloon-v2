		Porting all of my Spook Saloon code from the beginning of the bootcamp (lecture 6!) was a lot easier than I thought it would be.
		I can definitely feel SpringBoot pulling its weight for me in that department!
		Between the fragments standardization and the controller features it's a lot more streamlined now.

    <br><span id="spook_saloon" class="animate__animated animate__tada animate__repeat-3">Spook Saloon 2:</span>
    <br>Electric Boogaloo-n!

    <h4 style="text-align: center;">I'm so glad I realized I could make that joke.</h4>

<!-- I still want to have this intro here, but it wouldn't be in a multi-column grid... 

    <p>This is a little space for me to talk about my favorite thing ever:
        <br><span>TTRPGs!</span>
        <br>(it stands for "tabletop roleplaying games")
        <br> You've probably heard of Dungeons & Dragons - that's just one of the many TTRPGs out there!
    </p>

    The content below will probably be moved to the planned "Spook Saloon Staff" page eventually.

                Mozen here!
                <br>In the time since I coded... I mean opened the first Spook Saloon, I've created a few new characters that aren't on this site just yet.
                (That's because I haven't drawn them... yet.) Not so much progress on the creative front in general, really, but I should have more time to get back to those projects soon.
                <br>
                <br>The nice thing about this second Spook Saloon is that it's a reminder of why I really want to learn to code - expanding what I can do with my creative streak!
                I have this idea in my head that I could code my own website someday as a portfolio of all my creative works and have it be a demonstration of my coding skills as well.
                <br>
                <br>But in the meantime - have a seat! Grab a drink! Maybe join our staff? (I mean, not really, but the form was fun to make!)

                This is a different Mr. Cloud from the Mr. Cloud over in the first Spook Saloon, by the way. It's kind of like a Nurse Joy thing, where they're all related and look exactly the same,
                but are still distinct.
                <br>
                <br>This Mr. Cloud is fond of puns! He wants a jukebox in here someday. (No idea how I'm gonna code that in just yet, but it seems like it would be fun?)
                <br>
                <br>"My house got hit with a pretty big storm last night and I lost a quarter of my roof - oof!"
                <br>
                <br>That Mr. Cloud. He's such a jokester.
