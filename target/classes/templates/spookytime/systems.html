		        <p class="card-text">You know it, you love it, it's D&D! It's the system I started with back in high school.
                        <br>I revisited it again in my second year of college, and I've made some long-lasting
                        international friendships as a result. A couple of 5e games I was in also helped me during the pandemic,
                        and 5e also gave me the space to start exploring my gender identity.
                        <br>
                        <br>Since the construction of the first Spook Saloon, I joined a 5e game!
                        My character is Null, a super cocky and flashy ex-assassin shadow monk with no sense of self-preservation
                        ever since a god backed up the party with the ability to revive them. He's... a bit too confident
                        for his own good, but he holds his own.
                       	<br>The party is actually in the middle of fighting a priestess right now, who's being protected by monks
                       	from the same temple Null used to be a part of, as well as a vampire. Because the DM is awesome and I've been
                       	using my Ash Ketchum impression to voice Null, I have a belt of bombs that look like Poké Balls and I've been
                       	sticking bottles of alcohol to them to make molotov cocktails. And Null is probably the most normal of the group,
                       	given that one of the others is a chimeric druid wild shaped into a basilisk, and another just stole and ate a leech
                       	charm off the priestess, and the last is a goblin wizard who stole said priestess's staff and thus robbed her of both
                       	legendary actions she could have taken to escape the situation.
                       	<br>
                       	<br>Point is, I could talk about this all day. D&D makes crazy stories like that. I have so many.

		        <p class="card-text">Masks is a game about teenage drama and coming-of-age stories, and superheroes!
                    	Masks takes all the embarrassing and angsty emotional turbulence of teen drama
                    	and heightens it with powers. You're not just juggling homework and chores, maintaining friendships,
                    	and just trying to stay afloat in high school - you're also Spider-Man!
                    	Stuff like that. Think Young Justice and Teen Titans and you're in the right ballpark.
                    	<br>
                    	<br>I'm not in any Masks games right now - but most of the characters over in the Character Gallery
                    	are from previous Masks games. I've met a lot of my closest friends (and my current partner!) thanks to Masks
                    	and I appreciate how it encourages both the players and Game Master to lean into established superhero tropes
         				in the spirit of teenage shenanigans. One of my favorite moments was when my character had a massive crush on an
         				Atlantean prince who'd come to attend the superhero school dance, because his (arranged marriage) fianceé-slash-princess
         				was in attendance at the school. That princess was my character's superhero teammate. She called him out immediately afterwards
         				and it was a really funny moment of her going "I mean... I guess you can ask him out to the dance, but like. I'm also arranged to be
         				married to him, and I don't mind that. Just... don't expect much and don't make it weird?"
         				<br>
         				<br>Somehow my character managed not to make it that weird. It helped that the Atlantean prince was oblivious as all hell.

	                    GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL! The rulebook is a bit much to read through because they decided to put literally everything in one PDF,
	                    but if you're familiar with Pokémon's game mechanics, you probably have a good understanding of most of the interactions the rulebook describes.
	                    <br>
	                    <br>There are a lot of stats to keep track of, for both your character and each Pokémon you catch, and it takes a bit to figure out how many dice you're supposed to roll...
	                   	<br>That being said, it really does cover everything! You can interact with Pokémon in so many ways that aren't just battles now.
	                   	<br>
	                   	<br>I'm about to start a Pokérole game using their Mystery Dungeon rules, which is going to be so nostalgic for me.
	                	And that's the real draw at the end of the day - the nostalgia. And the love of Pokémon, of course.

		        <h5 class="card-title"><a href="https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week/">Monster of the Week</a></h5>
		        <p class="card-text">While Monster of the Week is meant to emulate hidden-world low-fantasy supernatural monster-hunting TV dramas,
					(yes, like Supernatural, and the monster of the week format/trope from which the game gets its name), the system's pretty flexible.
					It seems a bit difficult to run on the GM side because the investigative mystery format in general requires a bit of linear pathing,
					which goes against the sandbox nature of TTRPGs in general, so it requires the GM and players to be on the same page with regards to
					the overarching storyline and particular tropes to invoke. Two of the most memorable games I've played in this system have both leaned more on eldritch horror and cult themeing
					than standard supernatural creatures, and a large part of both games was a strong sense of the inspiration behind the world in question -
					one game was strongly based on similar themes to those in the Magnus Archives podcast, and another leaned heavily on settings and imagery similar to
					SCP stories and the more recent Backrooms creepypasta. The investigative parts can drag on a bit, and there's a bit of power imbalance
					between different playbooks (the system's version of character classes), but with the right GM the world of the game can really take on a life of its own.

		        <p class="card-text">
                    	Taking its inspiration from JoJo's Bizarre adventure and the Persona games, Eidolon makes explicit the connection between
                    	the eponymous Eidolon spirit-forms and their owners' psyches. A character's Eidolon represents their mindset on how they interact with the world
                    	and resist both the forces of the Undertow and the temptation to just go with the flow when the going gets tough.
                    	<br>
                    	<br>A friend introduced me to this one, and she was introduced to it by way of a podcast (also accessible through the link). You can really be as
                    	creative and bizarre (heh) with your powers as you'd like. Or you can be like one of my friends and play a talking bear that just wants food, if you want.
                    	And yes. Your Stand-slash-Eidolon can (and should!) be named after a song.</p>

		        <p class="card-text">
                    	This one gets a special mention because I actually helped playtest this one!
                   		This was a friend's senior project, in which she examined anthropological colonization through the lens of tabletop games.
                   		<br>
                   		<br>You can read more in the link, but the short version is that a lot of the worldbuilding and gameplay built into D&D
                   		often represents foreign cultures as exotic or savage, and the idea of looting dungeons of ancient civilizations
                   		plays into the idea that the player characters are entitled to take from these foreign cultures in the first place.
                   		<br>
                   		<br>Loaded for Bear has mechanics centered around characters interacting respectfully with foreign settlements and the environment around them,
                   		which led to a fascinating deconstruction of industrialization's hand in capitalist development in the game I was a part of. Constructing fictional cultures
                   		with the respect they deserve is a lot to ask of a DM! - or Facilitator! in this case - but it's a thought-provoking way to think about the decolonization process.</p>
