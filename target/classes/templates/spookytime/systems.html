		        <p class="card-text">You know it, you love it, it's D&D! It's the system I started with back in high school.
                        <br>I revisited it again in my second year of college, and I've made some long-lasting
                        international friendships as a result.
                        <br>A couple of 5e games I was in also helped me during the pandemic,
                        and 5e also gave me the space to start exploring my gender identity.
                        <br>
                        <br>Since the construction of the first Spook Saloon, I joined a 5e game!
                        My character is Null, a super cocky and flashy ex-assassin with no sense of self-preservation
                        ever since a god backed up the party with the ability to revive them. He's... a bit too confident
                        for his own good, but he holds his own.

		        <p class="card-text">Masks is a game about teenage drama and coming-of-age stories, and superheroes!
                    	Masks takes all the embarrassing and angsty emotional turbulence of teen drama
                    	and heightens it with powers. You're not just juggling homework and chores, maintaining friendships,
                    	and just trying to stay afloat in high school - you're also Spider-Man!
                    	Stuff like that. Think Young Justice and Teen Titans and you're in the right ballpark.

	                    - GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL! The rulebook is a bit much to read through because they decided to put literally everything in one PDF,
	                    but if you're familiar with Pokémon's game mechanics, you probably have a good understanding of most of the interactions the rulebook describes.
	                    <br>There are a lot of stats to keep track of, for both your character and each Pokémon you catch, and it takes a bit to figure out how many dice you're supposed to roll...
	                   	<br>That being said, it really does cover everything! You can interact with Pokémon in so many ways that aren't just battles now.
	                   	<br>
	                   	<br>I'm about to start a Pokérole game using their Mystery Dungeon rules, which is going to be so nostalgic for me.
	                	And that's the real draw at the end of the day - the nostalgia. And the love of Pokémon, of course.

		        <h5 class="card-title"><a href="https://reveal-your-master-plan.itch.io/eidolon">Eidolon</a></h5>
		        <p class="card-text">
                    	- Taking its inspiration from JoJo's Bizarre adventure and the Persona games, Eidolon makes explicit the connection between
                    	the eponymous Eidolon spirit-forms and their owners' psyches. A character's Eidolon represents their mindset on how they interact with the world
                    	and resist both the forces of the Undertow and the temptation to just go with the flow when the going gets tough.
                    	<br>
                    	<br>A friend introduced me to this one, and she was introduced to it by way of a podcast (also accessible through the link). You can really be as
                    	creative and bizarre (heh) with your powers as you'd like. Or you can be like one of my friends and play a talking bear that just wants food, if you want.
                    	And yes. Your Stand-slash-Eidolon can (and should)be named after a song.</p>

		        <p class="card-text">
                    	- This one gets a special mention because I actually helped playtest this one!
                   		This was a friend's senior project, in which she examined anthropological colonization through the lens of tabletop games.
                   		<br>You can read more in the link, but the short version is that a lot of the worldbuilding and gameplay built into D&D
                   		often represents foreign cultures as exotic or savage, and the idea of looting dungeons of ancient civilizations
                   		plays into the idea that the player characters are entitled to take from these foreign cultures in the first place.
                   		<br>
                   		<br>Loaded for Bear has mechanics centered around characters interacting respectfully with foreign settlements and the environment around them,
                   		which led to a fascinating deconstruction of industrialization's hand in capitalist development in the game I was a part of. Constructing fictional cultures
                   		with the respect they deserve is a lot to ask of a DM! - or Facilitator! in this case - but it's a thought-provoking way to think about the decolonization process.</p>
